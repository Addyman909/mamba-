			<p>Mamba Mentality is in the fabric of Los Angeles. Released in 2017 as a part of Nike's "Lore Series," and co-designed by Kobe Bryant, the 'Black Mamba' inspired Lakers City Edition uniform makes it return. This instant classic features a snakeskin print on the exterior contrasted by its black interior, 16 stars on the side panels, iconic 3-D-style lettering with a drop shadow, and the scoop neck from LA's Showtime era jerseys. But this isn't a one-to-one remake; for the first time, both of Kobe's retired numbers will share space on a single silhouette. Eight will grace the front and twenty-four will sit on the back, an arrangement that symbolizes Kobe's legendary career and the day dedicated to his impact on the game.</p>
